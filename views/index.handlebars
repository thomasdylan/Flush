      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>Sitting in class one day, we came to the reliazation that there was no way to to see a social media way to know
        which public restooms to use and the ones to avoid.
        Thus, FLUSH was born. We wanted to have a fun and inviting way to help people know what restooms are safe and
        clean to use.
