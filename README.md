## Description: 

-Social Media App that user can track the bathrooms that they go too in -
* Ability to rate on a 5 Star basis
* Map with pins of toilets tracked
* TMI button that includes blog-type info for each toil

## Problem This Project Solves -

    -what is a safe, and clean public restroom in my area?
    -what is the nicest restroom in my area?

## Motivation -

* We came to the realization that there was no way to see a social media way to know* which public restrooms to use and the ones to avoid. 	
	Thus, FLUSH was born. We wanted to provide 
 an inviting way to help people know what restrooms 
are safe and clean to use.

## Individual Responsibilities / Challenges - 

* Dylan

    -I was responsible for working on the routes and models with Luke as well asadding and logging in users that are stored in the database.  I faced a lot ofchallenges with the authentication switching from session to jwt to passportjust to get the project working correctly.  One improvement I would like to seefor this app is a map that allows users to track and pin where they have"flushed" and be able to display it on their profiles.
